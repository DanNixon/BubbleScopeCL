BubbleScopeApp
==============

A BubbleScope 360 degree image capture tool for V4L2 sources

Allows capture of 360 degree unwrapped and raw images and videos from a video capture device fitted with a [BubbleScope](http://store.bubblepix.com/).

Note that there are very few cameras that this works well with, [this](http://www.maplin.co.uk/p/zyno-1080p-hd-webcam-a98la) camera seems to be the best I can find, the best ones are those with a very short distance between the focusing lens and the image sensor (similar to the Raspberry Pi camera).

Requires OpenCV (tested with version 2.6).
