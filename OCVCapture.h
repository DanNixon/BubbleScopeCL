// This class can be used to capture OpenCV
// images from a Camera using video4linux.
// It has only been tested on one camera so far,
// the MS Lifecam VX-7000.
//
// The VideoCapture component in OpenCV calls on
// the video4linux driver to deliver uncompressed
// RGB images. The driver apparently asks the camera
// for a JPEG image and then decompresses it. On an ARM
// device such as a Beagleboard this is done in software
// using a meager floating-point unit and the result is
// so slow the board can't keep up, leading to error messages
// and scrambled images (in part due to race conditions in
// the OpenCV code.) This module asks the camera for YCbCr
// (aka YUV) images which avoids the JPEG path.
